i didnt write earlier but, i uploaded files from the main website at slackrr, god i hate this. i cant seem to make the background work at all..
idk if i missed a file or its just stupid and wont update fast enough, anyway type the website url with a dot at the end of (.io) --> (.io.) then type in the repository files
like Miku Mod, website url.github.io./Miku (make sure its the folder name EXACTLY) or it wont appear. - Mar.18.2025.10-27
